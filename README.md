# DB Demo
This project is a simple database implementation following the tutorial at https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial. This
repository exist for two reasons:

1. I want to understand how databases work underneath, specially the persistence and b-trees usage.
2. I want to practice a bit of Go that is an interesting language.
